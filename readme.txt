my solution likely includes the following components:

1. Node.js: This is the runtime environment i am using to execute JavaScript code on the server side.

2. Express: i am utilizing the Express framework, which simplifies the creation of APIs and routes by providing a set of tools and middleware for handling HTTP requests and responses.

3. Sequelize ORM: Sequelize is an Object-Relational Mapping library that facilitates interaction with relational databases. It allows you to define models for my data and perform database operations using JavaScript code.

4. Services for Fetching Orders: function that handle the retrieval of order data from the database. This include methods to fetch all orders, order for specific unique id.

5. Services for Creating Orders: function responsible for creating new orders in the database. we get input data from the client and then storing the order details in the database.

6. Routes: Within my Express application, i have defined routes that correspond to different endpoints for fetching and creating orders.

7. Database Configuration: my solution would include setting up a connection to my database using Sequelize's configuration options. This involves specifying the database type, host, credentials, and other relevant information in .env file.

8. Testing: I was only able to write a single test;


Overall, my solution combines Node.js, Express, and Sequelize to build a system that manages orders through APIs, leveraging the power of an ORM to interact with the database efficiently. i normalized order and services and made an extra mapping table.
I am assuming that data comes in correct format, for production build i will add controllers for bussiness logic right now the function is in route file itself, i will also do validation using joi for create and update requests.
