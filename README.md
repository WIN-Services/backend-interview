# WIN Backend Engineering Interview

## Scenario

Your mission is to build a portion of an order management system. You need to provide a service that allows other systems and teams to obtain information about orders.

## Deliverables

There are two deliverables for this project:

1. An internal web service API for managing orders
2. A test suite to validate the web service and library work as expected

### General

- Please use either **JavaScript/TypeScript or Python**.
- You may use any framework, such as a web framework or test framework, to help you complete the project.
- You may store the data for this system in any database you choose, however we've included a Docker image loaded with Postgres in this repo.
- You may model the data any way you'd like, including adding data beyond the samples provided.

### Web Service

- Your service should implement several endpoints that accept POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests. Also 1 endpoint that accepts GET all orders.
- Your service should handle edge cases appropriately and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Your service should return an error on creation/updating an order within 3 hrs of a pre-existing order.
- Your service should return JSON results.
- Your service should have at least one test.

## Sample Data

Below is some sample data you can use to populate your database. Feel free to extend or modify this data for your project:

Service Records

```json
[
  {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Inspection"
  },
  {
    "id": 789,
    "name": "Testing"
  },
  {
    "id": 456,
    "name": "Analysis"
  }
]
```

Orders

```json
[
  {
    "id": "223",
    "datetime": "2022-11-01T11:11:11.111Z",
    "totalfee": 100,
    "services": [
        {
        "id": "123",
        }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "224",
    "datetime": "2022-11-01T11:11:11.111Z",
    "totalfee": 100,
    "services": [
        {
        "id": "789",
        }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "225",
    "datetime": "2022-11-01T11:11:11.111Z",
    "totalfee": 100,
    "services": [
        {
        "id": "456",
        }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Duration

Up to 2 hours.

## Submission
1.  Clone this repo
2.  Create Web Services and tests
3.  Submit a Pull Request (PR)
4.  In the PR, include a README that includes the following:
      - A description of your solution at a high-level, including language used, framework used, roughly how it works, etc.
      - What trade-offs you made
      - Any assumptions you made that affected your solution
      - What you would change if you built this for production
      - Brief instructions on how to setup the environment to run your project
      - What parts of the spec were completed, how much time you spent, and any particular problems you ran into

## Evaluation
We are looking for: 
1. Communication
2. Solution Design
3. Completeness
4. Code clarity / readability



## Description
This project is an Order Management System implemented in Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB (Mongoose). It provides an API for managing orders and services. The application allows creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting orders.


## Trade-offs
The application prioritizes simplicity for demonstration purposes. In a production environment add authentication and authorization.

Data Storage: MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility with JSON-like documents. Depending on production requirements, a more structured relational database might be a better choice.


## Assumptions
The application assumes a basic understanding of Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
In a real-world scenario, security mechanisms should be a priority.

## Changes for Production

Implement authentication and authorization to secure the API endpoints.
Use a production-ready database with robust scalability and backup solutions.

## Environment Setup

Run npm install in the CLI,install all dependencies which you can see from package.json and then you are ready to go.


## Spec Completion

Internal web service API for managing orders.
CRUD operations for orders.
Validation of order creation requests using express-validator.
Prevention of order creation within 3 hours of an existing order.
Estimated time spent: 6-7 hours approx.

Challenges I faced are Setting up MongoDB and configuring Mongoose.
