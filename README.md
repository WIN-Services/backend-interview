**High-Level Description of Solution:**

For this project, I built a web application using the Express.js framework with a PostgreSQL database. It supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing data in the database.

Express.js serves as the backend framework, handling incoming HTTP requests and routing them to appropriate controller functions. The controller interacts with the database through a data access layer and returns responses to the client.

**Trade-Offs Made:**

1. **Simplicity vs. Scalability:** I prioritized simplicity for this project, which is suitable for a small-scale application. For production, I might consider a more scalable architecture with additional layers, caching mechanisms, and load balancing to handle a larger user base.

2. **Security vs. Development Speed:** Security concerns were addressed to some extent, but for production, I would spend more time on security measures such as input validation, authentication, and authorization.

3. **Testing Depth:** While I used Jest for testing, I focused more on unit testing the core functionalities. In a production-ready project, I would expand testing to include integration tests and end-to-end tests.

**Assumptions Made:**

1. The PostgreSQL database is already set up and running with the provided credentials.

2. The users of the application have a basic understanding of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and how RESTful APIs work.

**Changes for Production:**

To make this project production-ready, I would:

1. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities.

2. Add authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access certain routes and perform specific actions.

3. Implement logging to keep track of errors and monitor application performance.

4. Set up a proper error handling mechanism to return appropriate error responses to the client.

5. Deploy the application on a production server (e.g., AWS, Heroku) and use environment variables for sensitive data like database credentials.

6. Add more extensive tests, including integration and end-to-end tests, to ensure the application's stability and reliability.

**Environment Setup:**

To set up the environment to run the project:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

2. Clone the project repository.

3. Install dependencies by running `npm install` in the project root directory.

4. Create a `.env` file with the provided content and update the database credentials if needed.

5. Start the server by running `npm start`.

**Parts of the Spec Completed:**

The completed parts of the spec include:

1. Setting up the Express.js server.

2. Connecting to the PostgreSQL database.

3. Implementing basic CRUD operations for managing data in the database.

4. Using Jest for unit testing.

**Time Spent and Problems Encountered:**

I spent approximately 2 hours on this project. The majority of the time was dedicated to setting up the server, database connection, and implementing the basic CRUD operations.
