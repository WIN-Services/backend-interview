# Assumption

1. I assume that all service id are already present in service table

## Here are the requirements that have been successfully implemented as per the project's specifications:

1. I have created all the Services mentioned in the assignments.

2. No trafe-offs were made. Only felt that I could have added more number of tests but had to stick to less number of tests due to time constraint.

3. I spent around 5-8 hours doing this assignment because I worked on jest around 1.2 years ago and didn't remember about it a lot. So had to reasearch how to test the API's through jest and applied the same in this assignment. The time validation check and working with jest was interesting and fun at the same time. 

4. In conclusion, I would like to say that I enjoyed doing this assignment and it helped me expand my knowledge further.
