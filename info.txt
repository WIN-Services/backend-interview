For running this project 

Run command docker build -t my-node-app .
Then run docker compose up
By logging into db via any client at port 5433 run ddl.sql file ( making the tables and adding services )


Features not implemented ( Due to less time )

- Currently services are being added in table directly at start but services crud api file could be introduced for that

- The orders are all at global level since there was no user concept required but it can be change according to user
  where every order will belong to some user and so all queries would filter via user . User would be authenticated via jwt 

- We could place a validation layer ( via express middlewares ) upfront for validating the incoming payload ( yup is the library I would prefer to use for this)

- For simplicity purposes I have directly use node-pg and not used any orms .
